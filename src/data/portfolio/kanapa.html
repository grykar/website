<p>Kanapa is application to manage smart home modules. 
It allows programing behavior of each module by setup conditions (relations) between sensors. There are several sensors implemented in module: temperature, light, humidity, PWM, RGB indicator, relays, touch switches,  air quality, motion. Each module is based on AVR processor and communicate via wireless network by UDP protocol. Kanapa also covers setup conditions (relations) between modules. Commands send by modules are monitoring by Kanapa and can be analyses using reports.
The main role of Kanapa application is to setup and tuning intelligent home. Regardless of this fact, Kanapa gives interface to manage home remotely. The interface consists of buttons which can be defined by user.</p>
